## 📦 Features

- Random Forest-based dietary intake prediction using microbial abundance changes  
- Species-level microbial feature selection via Kruskal-Wallis tests  
- Cross-validation, multi-class ROC/AUC analysis, and node-size tuning  
- Comparison of Random Forest and LASSO classifiers under repeated cross-validation  
- Validation via principal component removal to separate treatment effects from study effects  
- Supports 4-, 5-, and 6-diet configurations  
- Includes dummy microbiome dataset for application

## 🧬 Methodology Overview

### Preprocessing
- Convert paired-end microbiome data (baseline vs. end) to differential abundance matrix  
- Extract species-level Silva features and rename for modeling compatibility  
- Define datasets based on number of food categories (4, 5, or 6 diets)  

### Feature Screening
- Kruskal-Wallis test per diet to select top discriminative microbes  
- Pool features across diets and pass to classifier  

### Classification
- Random Forest model with node-size tuning  
- LASSO comparison using multinomial regression  
- Cross-validation (50-fold) for performance robustness  

### Validation
- Use PCA to subtract control-related variance  
- Train model on residual treatment signal  
- Test the model on both treatment and control sets
